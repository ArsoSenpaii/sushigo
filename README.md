# This is a project for AI class.

I'm developing an AI that will play a game called "Sushi Go!". https://ultraboardgames.com/sushi-go/game-rules.php
Currently at Phase 1.

|1|   4 Bots plays random cards and code can determine total points and winner            |
|2|   User can play the game via console             |
|3|   Develop a GUI             |
|4|   User can play the game via GUI            |
|5|    Develop an AI             |
|6|  Make AI undefeatable             |



Note: I don't know how to developei an AI. I won't use machine learning (prohibited). I don't know how to code in python. I don't know how to create a GUI in python. I don't know how to create a GUI that user can interact with. I don't know shit, any help will be appreciated.

But hey, i have 3 months and I'm excited to learn new things! (No i don't, its joever. FF go brrrrr)
